                    <ol>
                        <li>Choose item to post for sale.</li>
                        <li>Display item and take a good picture ( make sure it&rsquo;s clean and not looking bad if it&rsquo;s used) If new please take it out of its original packaging if at all possible.</li>
                        <li>Take a good picture or pictures can display up to 9 pictures and 1 video of the same item or multiple items we will go over this a little more shortly, Also you can split the one item up into 4 pictures in the same frame, keep in mind they may not be able to zoom in as well. Also you can display the original packaging in the background of your product.</li>
                        <li>We recommend when taking the pictures that you use a cardboard with felt on it behind the products to keep anything behind hidden, this is good for two purposes, it keeps people from being distracted by items you don&rsquo;t want to have displayed, (like a messy room) or security you might unknowingly have something behind the picture that may put your personal information out there if someone was to zoom in.</li>
                        <li>Now the nuts and bolts of the site, go to JORTinc.com and pull up the site, choose seller.</li>
                        <li>Follow the easy prompts to create a seller profile, if your using a laptop or a desktop you will either have to upload your pictures from email or download them from your phone or camera onto your device before posting them.</li>
                        <li>
                            Now we have 4 different type of sales.
                            <ol>
                                <li>Basic 1 on 1 auction sale, you post a product the picture/pictures and sell it in the normal fashion.</li>
                                <li>A service Auction this can be anything from hourly service like, plumbers, electricians, to doctors, dentist, or Attorneys it can also be movies, restaurants, grocery items, speciality shops like nails, hair, massage, as well as weekend get aways at a resort, spa, winery or whatever the possibilities are endless. Basically it&rsquo;s simple, you choose what type of service you have to offer and then what the limit or reserve should be and then you post it for pre-bids just like a one on one Auction then when it goes live you will be notified and then when it sells you will be notified to let the buyer know how they will be able to collect on their win.</li>
                                <li>Now the fun, we have what is called a booty sell, OK get your mind out of the gutter it&rsquo;s not a booty call lol, it&rsquo;s what we refer to a simple multiple item sell, that you can post up to 9 items and a short video on the site, these items are all sold with one price that way you can liquidate quickly if you have allot of things to sell and your not really worried about the items all going. So one price gets them all. Again you can choose the limit and the reserve.</li>
                                <li>Now the Junk sell. This is the final sell we have, again you can list up to 9 items and no we are not asking you to put junk on the site we want clean and workable products as well as new products, the junk sell can have up to 9 items at each item will have a separate price. So that you can sell allot of your products but get what the true value is for each item.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Choose your bid increase, your limit or your reserve, choose a aprox amount for shipping or wether its free shipping.</li>
                        <li>Set yourself a reminder that when it goes live you will be able to go back and watch the sell, we recommend that you come back to the site after 5.5 to 5 Â¾ hrs to see how the prebids are doing. You will receive a email letting you know when it goes live as well as when the item product or service is sold so you can ship it out, we prefer shipping happens the same day as the sell as soon as you get paid for the goods or services.</li>
                        <li>You will also get a break down of exactly how the payout went, our commission, as well as any credit card charges and shipping fees if you including the approximation in your sale.</li>
                        <li>Again we ask that you ship the goods or service the same day so the buyer can get what they paid for in a timely manner.</li>
                    </ol>
