                                <li>We encourage all sellers to have a warranty on their products this however is not always the case so as usual it&rsquo;s buyer beware. But if you receive your item that doesn&rsquo;t match the description or not what you ordered.</li>
                                <li>The item needs to be shipped the same day as the sale, when you purchase an item make sure you get a tracking number, if you don&rsquo;t receive a tracking number contact customer support.</li>
                                <li>We as well will track items so make sure the address the item is to be shipped is correct.</li>
                                <li>We encourage feedback both good and bad. It helps us improve.</li>
                                <li>When Pre-bidding on an item you may not have the winning bid, so make yourself available when it goes live however if there are no more bids once the item is live the highest pre-bid wins.</li>
                                <li>Once you win an item we expect payment right away. This can be done through Stripe.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4 className="display-3">Sellers Terms</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>We require you to post any used items on our site that these items are clean, and in working conditions and that you can and will validate this.</li>
                        <li>Your ultimately responsible for any shipping cost, most people add on a small percentage to the cost for shipping, you can always make a note in the description the standard shipping cost of the item/items that your selling or a % of the final winning bid, but if nothing is put into the description what the customer wins they pay, you cannot go back and charge shipping so please keep this in mind when placing your items on the site. Services are a lot different. I&rsquo;ll get into that later.</li>
                        <li>Be aware that we use Stripe, and currently I don&rsquo;t have all of the requirements that stripe is requesting upon writing this. But subject to change, you will have to sign up for a stripe account upon agreeing with these terms.</li>
                        <li>We offer new and used items and services to be sold on our site, we don&rsquo;t allow any weapons such as knives or guns to be sold or any other weapon that constitutes the use of inflicting bodily harm to someone else, ie: nunchucks, chinese throwing stars, or any other weapon. We also will not allow anykind of pornagraphic material or sex toys to be sold, as well as no drug paraphernalia, Anything that we find on the site that portrays to anything in the before mention category will be removed and the offender will get one warning, As in baseball we will follow the 3 strikes rule, except there is no other game or more innings once your out, if you violate this you will no longer be able to sell anything more on our site.</li>
                        <li>We want to have a nice and good experience for all walks of life, as far as I know we are the only site that allows to sell services on our site, now their are literally thousands of different services that are offered out there, from professional services like, doctors attorneys, dentist, accountants just to name a few, to blue collar like, plumbers, electricians, carpenters, you get my drift also there are hotels, restaurants, resorts and such. But another that will not be tolerated and will be removed immediately and you will get banned from this site is the sell of so called sex service, now if you have a legitimate massage business that offers medical massages and this can be verified by our site administrator we will allow this, but we are not a pimp company nor do we want to build the reputation of such. So if you&rsquo;re in this line of work, that&rsquo;s your business please don&rsquo;t make it part of ours.</li>
                        <li>Services to continue on you will be required to offer either a printable voucher or a downloadable link for the winning bid of your service. We want to have you on our site and encourage every service to come and place your business for sale here, but we also want and require a complete description of the type of service the customer is getting in what they pay for. (Example: Joe&rsquo;s electrical company will come out and do a 2 hour inspection of your home or business. The normal cost of this is $150.00 but we will start the bidding at $50.00), and then you will provide a voucher or downloadable link once the person wins the auction for this service.</li>
                        <li>Shipping the items out, as stated before you are required to ship or provide the means for the winning bid to receive their item, we request that you do so immediately after the auction closes for your sale. That way the customer receives what they pay for asap if it&rsquo;s coming overseas or long distance please include in the description that it may take awhile for the customer to get it, like (please allow 3-4 weeks for delivery.)</li>
                        <li>If you have multiple items that you intend to put up for sale please state that in your description that way if the customer wants more of the same item they can choose to pay the same price or you can place them to extend to another auction, we will have that option available to basically roll over until all of your products are sold.</li>
                        <li>Returns and refunds, now this is a test subject because we have used items to sale as well as new one&rsquo;s and the bottom line is it&rsquo;s buyers beware, but we ask that when you put a item up for sale on our site to be bid on that it&rsquo;s clean and in working order, and we also understand that not everyone is happy and things happen when items are shipped, some of the delivery companies aren&rsquo;t well known for their best and most careful of handling of packages and when something is marked fragile it should say drop this or kick here. All I am asking is to try to do what you say and say what you do. Refund the money or at least be decent about it, now some people may be like my 2nd wife no matter what. They are never happy, but we can&rsquo;t pick and choose who customers are, just all I ask is please be accommodating.</li>
                    </ol>
